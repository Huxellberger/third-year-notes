In Semester One, of this course we covered zero and non-zero sum games (Nash
games) and search algorithms to find equlibriums (minimax and alpha beta
pruning). In this semester, we are no longer assuming that each player has the
same `role' and the games are zero-sum. We are letting there be an infinate
number of positions for each player and not assuming perfect information.

We're going to be looking at Stackleberg games; an example of which could be
retail pricing. Different firms might offer different prices on products, they
can choose infinate price points (or close enough) and some firms might have
private information that others might not.

An industry can be controlled or dominated by a one, more or entity:

\begin{description}
  \item \textbf{Monopoly}: When an industry consists of a single firm.
  \item \textbf{Duopoly}: When an industry consists of two firms.
  \item \textbf{Oligopoly}: When an industry consists of a few firms (and when
  each decision one takes impacts on the other's profits).
\end{description}

In duopoly/oligopoly situations, the roles of the players are different. If one
firm chooses to change its prices first, then the others have to decide what to
do in light of the change; and may not know the full economic and/or political
motivations behind the initial move.

In a two player Stackelburg game, one player selects his strategy first, and
then the other responds. The first player is caled the leader ($P_L$) and the
second is called the follower ($P_F$). In a Nash game, the players select their
strategy simultaneously.

There are payoff functions for the leader and follower, where each player wants
to maximise their own:

\[
  J_L(U_L, U_F)
\]

\[
  J_F(U_L, U_F)
\]

A strategy space is the set of all possible strategies for a single player. The
leader's strategy space is $U_L$ and the follower's is $U_F$. They can include
finite (discrete) or infinate (continous) strategies. The leader must choose
$u_L \in U_L$ and the follower must choose $u_F \in U_F$.

% Slide 20??

In a Stackleberg game, the leader first announces his strategy $u_L$, and then
the follower selects his best response $R(uL) \in U_F$ which maximises:

\[
  J_F(u_L, R(u_L)) = MAX_{u_F \in U_F} J_F(u_L, u_F)
\]

In order to solve a Stackleberg game, we need to solve the following problem:

\begin{itemize}
  \item What is the follower's reaction function $R(u_L)$?
  \item When we've found that, what leader strategy $u_L$ maximises the leader's
  payoff function:
  \[
    J_L(u^*_L, R(u^*_L)) = MAX_{u_L \in U_L} J_L(u_L, u_L)
  \]
\end{itemize}

If the follower has a reaction function $R(U_L)$ and there exists a leader
strategy $U^*_L \in U_L$ and the response strategy is $u^*_F = R(U^*_L) \in U_F$
such that $J_L(u^*_L, u^*_F) = MAX_{u_L \in U_L} J_L(u_L, R(u_L))$, then
$(u^*_L, u^*_F)$ is called a \textbf{Stackeberg strategy/equilibrium}.

We always assume that the follower is rational and tries to find the best
reaction strategy. Sometimes this is untrue, for example if taking a non-optimal
strategy results in a rival player having a big loss.

For a player to be a leader, he needs to act first. There is no requirement that
they are a leader in an economic or political sense. The only requirement to be
a follower is to act second; the follower is not nececcarily in a weaker
position. As mentioned before, Stackeburg games can be continuous or discrete,
depending on if the strategy space is finite or infinate.

Since the only difference between a Nash game and a Stackleberg game is whether
moves are played simultaneously or in order, should we prefer Nash or
Stackleberg games? If the player has the opportunity to be the leader, then
Stackeberg games should be prefered, since he will always be better off than in
a Nash game in this instance. Here's a mini-proof:

Let $u_1$ and $u_2$ be the strategies for player's one and two, and let
$J_1(u_1, u_2)$, $J_2(u_1, u_2)$ be their respective payoff functions. If there
is a Stackleburg strategy and a Nash strategy, then:

\[
  J_1(u^{Stackleberg}_1, u^{Stackleberg}_2) \geq J_1(u^{Nash}_1, u^{Nash}_2)
\]

I don't understand the next bit on page 29...

Note that sometimes the follower can be better off in a Stackleburg game, but
the leader would still be better off playing the Stackleburg game than playing a
Nash game. Other times, the player could win as the leader or follower, but win
better as the follower.

For the follower to play the game, he needs to know nothing about the leader or
his strategy space. However, for the leader to play, he needs to know the
follower's payoff function and strategy space in order to work out the action
that will give the max payoff. If such information is not available, then the
leader must guess or learn it (based off previous experience or data).
