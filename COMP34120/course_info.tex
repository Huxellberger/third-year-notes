\section*{Overview}

The aim of this semester is to understand the following topics.

What are Stackleberg (Leader-Follower) games? What constitutes a solution to a
Stackleberg game? How can learning and optimisation be used to learn good
solutions? Applications to price setting and marketing will be discussed.

What is reinforcement learning and how is it applied to on-line learning? What
are the important mechanisms of on-line learning? How can reinforcement learning
be applied to games situations?
