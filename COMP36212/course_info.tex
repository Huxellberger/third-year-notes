\section*{Overview}

This course will explore certain classes of algorithms for modelling and
analysing complex systems, as arising in nature and engineering. These examples
include: flocking algorithms - e.g., how schools of fish or flocks of birds
synchronised; optimisation algorithms; stability and accuracy in numerical
algorithms.

\section*{Aims}

By the end of the course, students should:
\begin{itemize}
\item Appreciate the role of using nature-inspired algorithms in
computationally hard problems.
\item Be able to apply what they learnt across different disciplines.
\item Appreciate the emergence of complex behaviours in networks not present in
the individual network elements.
\end{itemize}

These notes are based off of both the course notes (found on Blackboard). Thanks
to the course staff (<names>) for such a good course! If you find any errors,
then I'd love to hear about them!
