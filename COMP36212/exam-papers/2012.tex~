  \item Evolutionary algorithms are driven by selection and variation.

    Selection aims to remove members of the population that have a low
    fitness, and retain individuals with a high fitness in the
    population. This can be achived through a variety of methods, but
    usually starts with scoring each individual against the value of
    an objective function, and then using a weighted random selection
    to determine which individuals to remove from the population (such
    as with a roulette wheel, stochastic ranking or a tournament).
