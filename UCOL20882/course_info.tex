\section*{Overview}

Biological topics often feature in the news or entertainment media and are
frequently sensationalised or subject to inaccurate reporting.  We will consider
the science behind the headlines to help you develop an informed opinion
regarding the complexities of current biological issues.

So, if you have an interest in biology but havenâ€™t had the opportunity to study
it at a higher level, then this is the unit for you.

Topics covered in previous years include DNA and evolution, genome sequencing,
stem cells, biodiversity, brain function and emerging infectious diseases.
