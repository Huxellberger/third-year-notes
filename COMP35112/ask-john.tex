- Slide 18, lecture 7: Why is the load linked flag removed if the
thread is descheduled?

- Slide 10, lecture 11: TM wouldn't guarantee that you solve the
problem first time though, right? There may be cases where there are
no paths and you need to remove routes (i.e. backtrack)?

- GPU Lecture: Is the old architecture of the GPU (pre CUDA) relevant
for the exam?

- Exam questions (technique): on past papers, I find myself putting
loads down for the first part of the question, and then repeating
myself later. Any advice?
