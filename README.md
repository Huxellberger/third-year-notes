# Third year notes

The aim of this project is to create a comprehensive set of notes on the course
material covered by the whole of the third year of the BSc Computer Science
course at the University of Manchester.

As always, if you're revising from these notes, don't trust the material at all;
I don't have a doctorate degree, and lots of the content here hasn't been
proofread particurlaly thoroughly. Pull requests are very much appreciated!
